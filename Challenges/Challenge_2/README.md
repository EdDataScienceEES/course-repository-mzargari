### This repository contains all files for Challenge 2 Group 2.

The aim of this repository is to create a final figure and a brief to a newspaper related to the current energy crisis in Europe. We want to know which countries have the biggest emergency oil stocks in the EU and how countries have been reacting to the rise in prices in April. 

The repository includes the data, scripts, plots and newpaper brief as well as challenge instructions, meeting notes and common coding etiquette.
