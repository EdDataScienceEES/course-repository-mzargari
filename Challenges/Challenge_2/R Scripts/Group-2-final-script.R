#                               Purpose of Script:                                   #
#                                                                                    #
#   This script creates a map of European countries and shows how much emergency oil #
#     stock they have based off of the number of days their reserves will last them. #
#   This script also creates a boxplot of the percentage change in emergency oil     #
#      stocks in European countries following the increase in oil prices in          #
#              April 2021. We then get both outputs and combine them to              #
#                            output within a single panel                            #
#                                                                                    #     
#             These conclusions are based on data from the following link:           #
#  https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/nrg_stk_oem/default/table?lang=en  #

# 1. Installing Packages ----

# install.packages("tidyverse")
# install.packages("sf")
# install.packages("ggthemes")
# install.packages("gridExtra")
# install.packages("RColorBrewer")

# 2. Load the Libraries ----

library(tidyverse)           # For cleaning/wrangling data                    
library(sf)                  # For plotting map data              
library(ggthemes)            # Extra themes, geoms and scales for ggplot2
library(gridExtra)           # Plot arrangement
library(RColorBrewer)        # Allows us to pick a colour gradient 


# 3. Import the data ----

emergency_oil_stocks <- read.csv("Data/emergency-oil-stocks.csv")

# Explore the data to see what it looks like 

# Explore the European emergency oil stocks data.
head(em_oil_stocks)     # show top 6 rows of data 
str(em_oil_stocks)      # tells you the nature of the variables 
                        # (continuous, integers, categorical or characters)

# 4. Clean the data ----
# We decided to exclude Aug.21 from map data due to too many NA values

# Change name of first column to "Countries".
names(emergency_oil_stocks)[1] <- paste("Countries")

# We decided to exclude Aug.21 from map data due to too many NA values
oil_data <- emergency_oil_stocks %>% 
  filter(!(Countries=="")) %>%  # remove excess rows
  select(!("Aug.21"))           # very few countries have data for August 
  
# 5. Create a common theme ----

# Define a theme function to be used in the barplot and that can be used for future
# plots that we produce within our newspaper :) 

theme_group2 <- function(){            # creating a new theme function
  # define font, font sizes, text angle and alignment

# 6. Create the map ---- 
# Showing average European emergency oil stocks data 

# i. Transform the data set ----

  filter(!is.na(oil_data_complete_map$Avg_em_stocks)) %>%

# 7. Create the barplot ---- 
# showing the percentage change in emergency oil stocks for European countries 

# i. Tidy the data for the bar plot ----

# Remove columns and rows with incomplete data
# calculate percentage change in emergency oil stocks for each European country that remains.
oil_data_barplot <- oil_data %>% 
  filter(is.finite(Jul.21)) %>%    # remove rows with insufficient data   
                                   # can also use drop_na(Jul.21)
  mutate(mean_before = rowMeans(select(., Jan.21:Apr.21)), # create column for January to April
         mean_after = rowMeans(select(., May.21:Jul.21)),  # create column for May to July
         percentage_change = ((mean_after-mean_before)/mean_before)*100) %>% 
  # create column that calculates percentage change between (Jan-Apr) and (May-Jul)
  mutate(percentage_change = replace(percentage_change, is.na(percentage_change), 0)) %>%
  filter(percentage_change^2 >= 1) %>%    # only keeps value that show a % change greater than 1%
  mutate(ymean = mean(percentage_change)) # create a column of the average % change in oil stocks


# ii. Plot the barplot ----

(emergency_oil_barplot <- ggplot(oil_data_barplot,

# 8. Create function to save outputs ----

# Define new function to save the map and the barplot both in png and pdf at the same time: 

save_plot <- function(plot_name, # first put the plot object name
                      file_name = "plot",  #give it a title 
                      width = 13, # set the width, height and dots per inch (DPI)

    dpi = dpi) 
  
  # save as pdf

    paste0(file_name, ".pdf"), 
    plot_name, 
    width = width, 
    height = height, 
    dpi = dpi
  )
}

# 9.Save the individual outputs ----
# use the save plot function created to save barplot
save_plot(emergency_oil_map, 
          file_name = "Plots/Final-Output-Emergency-oil-map", 
          width = 13,

          width = 13, 
          height = 8, 
          dpi = 150) 

# 10. Save the panel ----
# Save a plot that combines the two graphs 
save_plot(grid.arrange(emergency_oil_map, emergency_oil_barplot, ncol = 2), 
          file_name = "Plots/Final-output-panel", 
          width = 20,
