# Map Workflow

The map figure of our data journalism project depicts the amount of emergency
oil stocks various european countries have, measured in the amount of days until
the stocks would be exhausted. These are illustrated on a colour gradient 
whereby Finland has the greatest quantity and Norway (among others) have the 
lowest quantity.
