         What does Europe's recent surge in energy prices mean? Why are countries like Finland investing in Emergency Oil Stocks?

As we slowly yet steadily make our way out of the pandemic, with the hard-hit economy 
making progress, another threatening obstacle seems to have presented itself, posing major 
questions at the European national level of preparation. One might presume that after the Coronavirus 
mishap, countries would surely be apprehensive, with clear intent for a smooth 
economic recovery.

However, recent developments in the energy sector indicate the complete opposite, with natural
gas prices soaring recently. At Europe’s leading benchmark for gas prices in the Netherlands
“Title Transfer facility” prices have skyrocketed from 18€ in early January to 88€ in late 
October, a surreal increase of more than 450%.

Although Europe has already begun its shift towards renewables, the recent energy crisis indicates 
the huge dependency nations still have on fossil fuels with Natural gas and coal still supplying over 
35% of the EU's production.

"This is about a surge in demand for energy as we come out of the restrictions imposed by the 
pandemic, combined with a reduced supply of gas on the global market," Tim Gore, head of 
the Low Carbon and Circular Economy programme at the Institute for European 
Environmental Policy (IEEP), told BBC.

What's more, this problem seems to have been exacerbated somewhat since it coincides with countries
shifting their reliance away from ruinous fossil fuel energy sources, in a time when wind turbines 
aren't producing high levels of energy.

Still, the reduced supply in gas is not entirely justified without, at least, considering
the political landscape in play. Russia is one of the main culprits for the shortages in supply, 
as a result of Putin’s attempts to capitalize on the crisis by pushing forward the Nord Stream 
2 pipeline, which spans 1200 kilometres and runs across the Baltic, from Russia to Germany.

Putin finally broke character and ordered Russian-run Gazprom to begin filling storage 
facilities from November. “This should certainly create a favourable situation on the 
European energy market, or at least a more favourable one,” Putin told Gazprom’s chief 
executive Alexei Miller in a televised meeting.

This action moved the European benchmark to 80€ per megawatt hour, a 6% decline with 
speculation of the upcoming gas provision driving this change. However, with most European 
facilities being almost empty, the crisis seems far from over.

As a complete green energy shift in Europe will take many years to become reality, 
countries need to be prepared for similar unfortunate events. Global strategic petroleum 
reserves are referring to petroleum inventories held in reserves of a particular country to be 
employed in the case of an energy crisis. The possession of emergency stocks may prove 
critical in saving nations, heavily dependent on fossil fuels, from entering a vicious circle of 
economic woes, caused by a sudden shortage of supply.

Emergency oil stock landscape in Europe:

On the left of the panel is a map of European countries and their remaining emergency oil 
stocks (averaged out from January to July). The most prepared country (light pink) appears to 
be Finland with 154 days of remaining oil stocks, followed by Greece (123 days) and 
Belgium (103 days).  Interestingly enough, there are quite a few nations like Norway, Turkey, 
and Serbia with non-existent emergency oil stocks (deep red). Countries where data was not 
available are coloured in grey.

On the right of the panel, is a figure showing the percentage change in emergency oil stocks 
on 17 EU member-states after the sudden increase in prices from April 2021. With an 
increase of 11%, Finland also appears to be the biggest investor, during this crisis. Finland’s 
willingness to be canny, does not reflect the behaviour of the other 2 nations sharing the Top 
3 on current oil stocks. On the contrary Greece and Belgium with a 2% and 3% decrease in 
oil stocks respectively, are showing up in the two last places. Notwithstanding, Finland’s 
example was followed by most of the nations in Europe, and a 3.5% average increase in 
emergency oil stocks was realized throughout the continent. France (9.5% increase) and 
Ireland (8% increase) also invested heavily on oil stocks.

With trends like these, and other measures, like Spanish government’s attempts to cut special 
electricity tax from 5.1% to 0.5%, European nations are hoping to get away with their 
economies unscathed, as winter is coming.
