## Tutorial Introduction
The aim of this assignment is to introduce readers to data manipulation using SQL. I use four data sets: two relating to trees and two relating to industry pollution, however, the bulk of the tutorial is with the trees data set since it is simpiler to understand. The tutorial focuses on data manipulation in SQL with an environmental data science lens, however, data sets may be swapped for a variety of different diciplines.

My tutorial teaches data manipulation as a quantitative skill for people of all backgrounds. The goal of the tutorial is to teach users how to query data, edit it, use it to find trends, and even visualize those patterns -- all in SQL.

## Tutorial Learning Objectives:

#### 1. Become familiar with data manupulation in SQL.
#### 2. Create new columns and tables by combining two datasets.
#### 3. Learn to find averages, sums, minimums, maximums, and counts.
#### 4. Appreciate the versatility and user friendly nature of SQL.
#### 5. Filter, order, and organize your data to explore specific trends.
#### 6. Build beautiful graphs to uncover patterns in data.

## My Tutorial Workflow 

1. Find out what quantitative skill means.
2. Choose a skill to teach: I found data manipulation was a topic I understand well.
3. Define the learning objectives for the assignment.
4. Upload a markdown document where I type the tutorial.
5. Create a table of contents which outlines what I want to teach.
6. Type the tutorial, section by section (adding images where relavent, making it fun and engaing).
7. Publish the markdown document onto Github pages.
8. Organize repository, adding README files for all folders.
