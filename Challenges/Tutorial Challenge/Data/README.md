## This folder contains all the .csv files that I used in my tutorial.

### __Source for trees data__: https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/csv/csv.html

### __Source for pollution data__: https://www.stats.govt.nz/large-datasets/csv-files-for-download/

##### For the trees data, I added the "age" column, but everything else is original.

##### The trees2 data set is completely made up (only the id numbers are the same).

##### For the pollution data, I renamed the files (originally named Greenhouse-gas-emissions-by-region-industry-and-household-Year-ended-2019-csv which may be found on the website) and split it up into two data sets for the purposes of this assignment. I also changed the column names for readability.
