1. What is the data source?  Do you have permission to use the data?
I will be using the LPI_species dataset provided in the course repository. More specifically, I will be using datasets pertaining to Atlantic salmon populations. This data comes from 20 different data sources. These 20 unique sources may be found in the assignment repository and may be also found via this link:

2. What is the aim of this study?
The aim of this study is to report on the population trends of Atlantic Salmon over the years of
1970 to 2010.


3. What's the main question being asked or hypothesis being tested in this study?

The main question that is being asked is how have salmon populations of eggs, smolts, and adults 
changed between 1970 and 2010?


4. Describe the key independent and dependent variable(s).
Independent variables would be time.
Dependent variables would be the the salmon populations of eggs, smolts, and adults.


5. What are the spatial and temporal structures to the data (number of sites, duration in years, etc.)?
The spatial structures to the data are the region and country that the respective data belongs to.
Currently, there are 864 observations across 6 countries that were collected.

The temporal structures are the different years that the data is collected. This spans a 40 year 
period between 1970 and 2010.


6. What is the overall sample size?
The overall sample size is 864 different data points/populations spread across 6 countries.


7. Specify exactly which analyses you will conduct to examine the main question/hypothesis.
I will use a mixed effects model to regress time onto the different scaled salmon populations to see 
if there is any effect on them with country and sampling method being taken into account
as random effects. 
My goal is to look into the trends to see the changes of salmon egg, smolt, and adult populations
between 1970 and 2010.
