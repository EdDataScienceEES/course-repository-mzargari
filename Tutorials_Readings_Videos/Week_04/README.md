# Introduction to data manipulation in R
Learning to wrangle data with base R and the *Tidyverse*

1- Using base R and logical operators to subset dataframes or replace values

2- Making data tidy using `gather()`from `tidyr` <br>

3- Manipulating data with the intuitive `dplyr` tools <br>

This repository contains the files necessary to complete Coding Club's [Intro to Data Manipulation](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2017/01/06/data-manip-intro.html) tutorial.
