# This repository contains all files for the Course Repository Challenge.

The aim of this repository is to organize all my work from the Fall 2021 semester. This repository is split up into folders which are outlined below:

### Course_Notes_and_Links:
A folder containing the notes that I took throughout this course. It also contains links to websites that have information that I have used throughout the semester which help explain many concepts we have learned.

### Tutorials_Readings_Videos:
A folder that contains all files, by week 'X', that we were assigned that I worked on. Each week, from week 1 to 10, contains the following folders
#### (1) Week_X_Assignments
A textfile containing all the readings, videos, and Coding Club tutorial links that were assigned and suggested for week X
#### (2) Week_X_Data 
A folder containing all the data I used that week for my tutorial assignments.
#### (3) Week_X_Tutorial_Work 
A folder for the code that I typed from the Coding Club tutorials. These coding files include my own comments and headers.
#### (4) [If applicable] Week_X_Outputs
A folder containing all the outputs from my Coding Club tutorial, if outputs were recorded.
