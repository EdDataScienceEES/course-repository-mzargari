## This repository contains all files for Challenge 3.

The aim of this repository is to create a final code and report that explains trends in Atlantic Salmon populations in the world to the WWF. We want to know how Atlantic Salmon populations of eggs, smolt, and adults have varied between 1970 to 2010 after doing an analysis of data coming from 20 different data sets.

The repository includes the data, scripts, plots, and report brief as well as challenge instructions (below) and the preregistration materials.
